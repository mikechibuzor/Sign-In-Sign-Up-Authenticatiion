Sign-In/Sign-Up authentication.
it basically simulates a real-world Sign-In/Sign-Up Authentication.


(I started working on this project when i only just started learning Vue. Half way into it,
i realized that it would make a lot of sense if i have grounded knowlege in Vue first, so
i kept it pending for a while.
Why i am writing this is that i see now how i could have made the structure of the code even
simpler but i will not do so because... well, it's my first Vue project.)
